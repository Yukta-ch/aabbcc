Practical 2
Aim: Create and deploy a block chain network using Hyperledger Fabric SDK for Java.
Background Information:

Block chain network:
•Blockchain is a type of shared database that differs from a typical database in the way it stores information. 
•Blockchains store data in blocks linked together via cryptography.

Hyperledger Fabric: 
•Hyperledger Fabric is an open-source platform for developing blockchain applications. 
•It is designed to support the development of scalable and secure blockchain applications and is suitable for a wide range of use cases, including supply chain management, identity management, and financial services.

Hyperledger Fabric SDK:
•Hyperledger Fabric SDK is a software development kit (SDK) that provides a set of tools and libraries for building applications that interact with a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain. 
•The Hyperledger Fabric SDK is available for a variety of programming languages, including Java, Go, Node.js, and Python.

Hyperledger Fabric SDK for Java:
•The Hyperledger Fabric SDK for Java is a set of Java libraries that provides a Java API for interacting with a Hyperledger Fabric blockchain. 
•It allows Java developers to build applications that can interact with a Hyperledger Fabric network, such as by submitting transactions or querying the blockchain.
•The Hyperledger Fabric Docker images and samples, you can deploy a test network by using scripts that are provided in the fabric-samples repository.
•The network is meant to be used only as a tool for education and testing and not as a model for how to set up a network

Prerequisites: To use the Hyperledger Fabric SDK for Java, you will need to have the following prerequisites installed:
•Java: You will need to have a recent version of the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
•Curl
•Docker
Contract APIs: To develop smart contracts executed on a Fabric Network.
Application SDKS: To develop your blockchain application.
The Application: Blockchain application will utilize the Application SDKs to call smart contracts running on a Fabric network.

Installation steps:
1.Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or later: Install JDK 11 or a later version on your system. You can download it from 
           Java Downloads | Oracle	
2.Install Ubuntu app from windows store: Open the Microsoft Store and install Ubuntu 20.04.02 LTS .
3.Open Windows Terminal (Command Prompt) and add a new ubuntu tab.
  Now “Ubuntu 20.04.02 LTS” is linked to Windows terminal.
4.Updating and installing basic packages for Ubuntu.
          #sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
5.Docker Desktop 4.25.2 or later (if using Dockized environment):
          Install Docker Desktop 4.25.2 or a later version if you want to use the 
          Dockerized environment. You can download it from
      Docker Desktop: The #1 Containerization Tool for Developers | Docker
Enable Docker for Ubuntu
 	Go to Settings
 	Resources
 	WSL integration
 	Enable Ubuntu-20.04
 	Then hit Apply & restart
 	After Enabling this we will get docker in the ubuntu command line.

6.Run following command to check if you are able to access it on Ubuntu.
     #docker version
     #docker compose version
7.Run following command to install and update basic packages on Ubuntu.
           #sudo apt update
          #sudo apt upgrade 
8.We will check if curl exist, if curl doesn’t exist we will install it with 
          #curl –v
         #sudo apt-get install curl 
9.We will check if go exist 
           #go version
    If go doesn’t exist we will install it with
    #sudo wget https://golang.org/dl/go1.16.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz
    Checking if go is installed
10.This command will extract zip file at the downloaded location.
#tar xvf go1.16.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz
11.Now we will set the path using following command
           #export GOPATH=$HOME/go
          #export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
         Run the following command to verify that Go lang is installed successfully.
         #go version
12.Run the following command to if git is installed
      #git –version
13.Install Hyperledger Fabric and Fabric samples.
14.Create a directory with following command
Creating a directory: mkdir -p $HOME/go/src/github.com/
Changing the directory: cd $HOME/go/src/github.com/
15.	Download the latest release of fabric samples and docker images.
Run following command under $HOME/go/src/github.com/ directory.
Cloning Hyperledger Fabric:
#curl -sSL https://bit.ly/2ysbOFE | bash -s 1.4.4
16. Go to test-network.
#cd test-network
#ll
#pwd
# cd first-network/
#ls
17.Generate ‘mychannel’.
          #./byfn.sh generate
18.Running following will boot up fabric test network.
#./byfn.sh up
19.Windows Security screen will be appeared on the screen => Click on Allow.
20.Final output:
Conclusion: 
Thus, blockchain network using Hyperledger Fabric SDK for Java Set up is created and the channel initializes successfully.
